# Train-Tracking
Matlab code that intakes an .mp4 or .avi of a train on a railway, and counts the number of cars, and classifies the type of car. The program utilizes background detection via Kalman Filters and Blob Mesh Masking

The only crucial files to this project so far are multiObjectTracking.m and compare_cars.dat, the other files are videos that I have been
testing as well as other database formats I am testing.
